Sometimes we want to create a parebt class that defines what to do aad not how to do. Generalized form that is gonna shared by evyone whho inherits it.

Creating instance variable, constructor, normal methods ( having body which may or maynot be overridden), static methods and variable inside a body is allowed.
We cant create abstract constructtor, we cant mark static methods as abstract because we know static methods are not meant to be overridden but making them abstract will mean that they need to get overridden .
We can also use abstract class name for the purpose of declaring reference variable typee pointing to any subclass ( Dynamic method dispatch ).
We can also  not ut final before abstarct class because outting final doesnt allow a class to get inherited.But we can have final methods and variables but methods must not be abstract.
Yes, final methods can be inherited. However, they cannot be overridden in the subclass. Multiple inheritance is not alllowed we cant create more than one abstract class and then inherit it


Sometimes you will want to create a superclass that only defines a generalized form that will be shared by all of its
subclasses, leaving it to each subclass to fill in the details. Such a class determines the nature of the methods that
the subclasses must implement.
You may have methods that must be overridden by the subclass in order for the subclass to have any meaning.
In this case, you want some way to ensure that a subclass does, indeed, override all necessary methods. Java’s solution
to this problem is the abstract method.
You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the abstract type modifier.

        abstract type name(parameter-list);

These methods are sometimes referred to as subclass's responsibility because they have no implementation specified in
the superclass.
Thus, a subclass must override them—it cannot simply use the version defined in the superclass.

Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared abstract.
# There can be no objects of an abstract class.
# You cannot declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods.
# You can declare static methods in abstract class.
Because there can be no objects for abstract class. If they had allowed to call abstract static methods,
it would that mean we are calling an empty method (abstract) through classname because it is static.
Any subclass of an abstract class must either implement all of the abstract methods in the superclass,
or be declared abstract itself.
Abstract classes can include as much implementation as they see fit i.e.there can be concrete methods(methods with body)
in abstract class.

Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object references,
because Java’s approach to run-time polymorphism is implemented through the use of superclass references.

A public constructor on an abstract class doesn't make any sense because you can't instantiate an abstract class directly 
(can only instantiate through a derived type that itself is not marked as abstract)

In interface methods are by default public and abstract, and variables are static and final -> not dependent on object.
No, when you compile a Java program, the compiler does not create a separate .class file for an interface.

Abstract class vs Interface:

Type of methods:
Interface can have only abstract methods.
Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.

Final Variables:
Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final.
An abstract class may contain non-final variables.

Type of variables:
Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
Interface has only static and final variables.

Implementation:
Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
Interface can’t provide the implementation of abstract class.

Inheritance vs Abstraction:
A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements”
and abstract class can be extended using keyword “extends”.

Multiple implementation:
An interface can extend another Java interface only,
an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.

Accessibility of Data Members:
Members of a Java interface are public by default.
A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
