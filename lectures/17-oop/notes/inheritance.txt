Parents have certain properties and behavior and children can use those properties and behavior depending on its accecibility.
Child class is inheriting properties and behavior of base class this is known as inheritance.

To inherit a class, you simply incorporate the definition of one class into another by using the extends keyword.
Child class will be having properties of base class as well as it will have some more properties of its own.

class subclass-name extends superclass-name { // body of class
}
You can only specify one superclass for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance of
multiple superclasses into a single subclass. You can, as stated, create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a subclass
becomes a superclass of another subclass. However, no class can be a superclass of itself.

Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of the superclass
that have been declared as private.    ->    although we can initialise it. Because here parent class constructor is being called which can access this private member
super()        ->            linked to constructor of parent class.

A Superclass Variable Can Reference a Subclass Object:
It is important to understand that it is the type of the reference variable—not the type of the object that it refers
to—that determines what members can be accessed.
When a reference to a subclass object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will have access only to
those parts of the object defined by the superclass.
But otherwise is not allowed because we should be able to access those variable depending on the type of reference but if we have reference variable of type child then we should be able to access all variables of child but we know we ahve an object of parent class which doesnt contain all those variables listed in child class.
Every class we create has object class as a super class

plainbox      =  weightbox;
(superclass)     (subclass)

SUPERCLASS ref = new SUBCLASS();    // HERE ref can only access methods which are available in SUPERCLASS

Using super:
Whenever a subclass needs to refer to its immediate superclass, it can do so by use of the keyword super.
super has two general forms. The first calls the superclass’ constructor.
The second is used to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.

BoxWeight(double w, double h, double d, double m) {
    super(w, h, d); // call superclass constructor
    weight = m;
}

Here, BoxWeight( ) calls super( ) with the arguments w, h, and d. This causes the Box constructor to be called,
which initializes width, height, and depth using these values. BoxWeight no longer initializes these values itself.
It only needs to initialize the value unique to it: weight. This leaves Box free to make these values private if desired.

Thus, super( ) always refers to the superclass immediately above the calling class.
This is true even in a multileveled hierarchy.

class Box {
     private double width;
     private double height;
     private double depth;

     // construct clone of an object

     Box(Box ob) { // pass object to constructor
       width = ob.width;
       height = ob.height;
       depth = ob.depth;
     }
}

class BoxWeight extends Box {
     double weight; // weight of box

     // construct clone of an object

     BoxWeight(BoxWeight ob) { // pass object to constructor
        super(ob);
        weight = ob.weight;
     }
}

Notice that super() is passed an object of type BoxWeight—not of type Box.This still invokes the constructor Box(Box ob).
NOTE: A superclass variable can be used to reference any object derived from that class.
Thus, we are able to pass a BoxWeight object to the Box constructor.Of course,Box only has knowledge of its own members.

A Second Use for super
The second form of super acts somewhat like this, except that it always refers to the superclass of the subclass in
which it is used.

super.member

Here, member can be either a method or an instance variable. This second form of super is most applicable to situations
in which member names of a subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass. That is used when we have same name of a variable in parent and base class.

super( ) always refers to the constructor in the closest superclass. The super( ) in BoxPrice calls the constructor in
BoxWeight. The super( ) in BoxWeight calls the constructor in Box. In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor
requires parameters, then all subclasses must pass those parameters “up the line.” This is true whether or not a
subclass needs parameters of its own.

If you think about it, it makes sense that constructors complete their execution in order of derivation.
Because a superclass has no knowledge of any subclass, any initialization it needs to perform is separate from and
possibly prerequisite to any initialization performed by the subclass. Therefore, it must complete its execution first.
That is super () must be the first statement to get executed.
if super() is not written in child class then defsult constructor of parent will be called.
if inside child class constructor :-
                            Child(Child other){
                                super(other);            //will work it is same as writing parent reference with child object.
                                weight = other.weight;
                            }

NOTE: If super( ) is not used in subclass' constructor, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass
will be executed.

Types of inheritance :-
1.    single inheritane
2.    multilevel inheritance
3.    multiple inheritance    -    when one class is extending more than one class    -    JAVA doesnt support multiple inheritance because of ambiguity if both parent class have same name of variable or function then occurs a ambiguity thatt which will be called if we would have called that.
4.    Hierarchical inheritance    -    one class is inherited by many class.
5.    Hybrid inheritance    -    combination of single and multiple inheritance (since we dont have multiple inheritance in java therefore Hubrid inheritance doesnt exist either)
                                            ----------------- A -----------------
                                           |                                    |
                                           |                                    |
                                           B                                    C
                                           |                                    |
                                           |                                    |
                                            ---------------- D ------------------
But we can acheive 3 and 5 using interfaces.

POLYMORPHISM :- Occurs during inheritance.
Many ways to represent a single entity.
Overloading  (Compile time polymorphism / static because java determines which function or constructor to call at compile time, type checking and which method to run  occurs at compile time)  -    Signature of the function should be different, in parameter list.But changing return type doesnt means overloading. Acheived in same or different class [Java doesnt have operator overoading]
Overriding  (Runtime / dynamic)  -    Signature of the function shpuld be exactly same. Acheived beween different class.

Using final with Inheritance:

The keyword final has three uses:

# First, it can be used to create the equivalent of a named constant.

# Using final to Prevent Overriding:
To disallow a method from being overridden, specify final as a modifier at the start of its declaration.
Methods declared as final cannot be overridden.
Methods declared as final can sometimes provide a performance enhancement: The compiler is free to inline calls to them
because it “knows” they will not be overridden by a subclass. When a small final method is called, often the Java
compiler can copy the bytecode for the subroutine directly inline with the compiled code of the calling method, thus
eliminating the costly overhead associated with a method call. Inlining is an option only with final methods.
Normally, Java resolves calls to methods dynamically, at run time. This is called late binding. However, since final
methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved at compile time. This is called early binding.

# Using final to Prevent Inheritance:
Sometimes you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class declaration with final.
NOTE: Declaring a class as final implicitly declares all of its methods as final, too.
As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both abstract and final since an abstract class is incomplete
by itself & relies upon its subclasses to provide complete implementations.

# NOTE: Although static methods can be inherited ,there is no point in overriding them in child classes because the
method in parent class will run always no matter from which object you call it. That is why static interface methods
cannot be inherited because these method will run from the parent interface and no matter if we were allowed to
override them, they will always run the method in parent interface.
That is why static interface method must have a body.

NOTE : Polymorphism does not apply to instance variables.
